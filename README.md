# Vue Design System

[Vue Design System](https://vueds.com) is an open-source tool for building UI design systems. It provides you and your team a set of organized tools, patterns & practices to build upon, so that you can get started with the actual design system faster.

The tool is built on top of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [Vue Styleguidist](https://github.com/vue-styleguidist/vue-styleguidist), [Vue Webpack Template](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) & [Theo](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/theo) and is aimed for designers and front-end developers who have at least basic knowledge of component based workflows + HTML, SCSS & JavaScript.

Even though this is a system prototyping tool first and foremost, it has all the means to turn into your organization’s actual design system in the end.
