### Vue Design System is an open source tool for building UI Design Systems with Vue.js. It provides you and your team a set of organized tools, patterns & practices that work as the foundation for your application development.

You’re looking at **[Vue Design System’s](https://vueds.com/)** demo documentation and component library. It serves as a resource that helps to define a common visual language for the components of this application. This library was built for our internal needs, but it can also be used to teach new hires about our approach to interface design and front-end development. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or improvement ideas.
