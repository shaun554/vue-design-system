**Principles** are a set of established design principles that are at the heart
of the design system. They should guide us when working with _Tokens_,
_Elements_, _Patterns_ and _Templates_. _(Everything you see here is user
editable, to change or remove this text, see [/docs/principles.md](https://github.com/viljamis/vue-design-system/blob/master/docs/principles.md). The
principles below are just an example, you should replace them.)_

1. **Design is how it works**
2. **Reduce concepts to increase confidence**
3. **Design with real data**
4. **Design systems, not pages**
5. **Involve code early**
6. **Fast is better than slow**
7. **Let content determine breakpoints**
8. **Strive for universality**
