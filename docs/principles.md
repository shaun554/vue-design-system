**Principles** are a set of established design principles that are at the heart of the design system. They should guide us when working with *Tokens*, *Elements*, *Patterns* and *Templates*. *(btw: everything you see here is user editable, to change or remove this text, see `/docs/principles.md`)*

1. **Design is how it works**
2. **Reduce concepts to increase confidence**
3. **Design with real data**
4. **Design systems, not pages**
5. **Involve code early**
6. **Fast is better than slow**
7. **Let content determine breakpoints**
8. **Strive for universality**
